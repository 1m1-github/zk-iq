# zk-iq
Prove that your `IQ` is greater or smaller than a specific value whilst keeping your exact `IQ` secret

## how
user faces an `IQ` test (frontend)  
user saves result privately  
user can proof to anyone: `IQ > T` or `IQ < T`  
without revealing `IQ`
to others using a `zkp` (zero knowledge proof)

## allow to proof: `IQ == T`
since a user could prove `IQ < T+1` and `T-1 < IQ`, they would essentially prove `IQ == T`  
if the user could do this anyways, make it easy for them (at least on the frontend)

## possible use cases
- employer might want minimum **IQ** requirement
- scholarship might want maximum **IQ** requirement
- dater might have **IQ** range requirements

## NFTs?
imagine a change in culture where people openly share their IQ to 'show-off'  
an NFT to prove a precise IQ or to proove "look, mine is at least this much" or to proove "look, mine is less than this"

## why `IQ`?
